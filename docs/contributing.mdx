We're happy to hear that you want to contribute to alphaTab. There are many ways to contribute to alphaTab.
You can report bugs, request features or actually start contributing to the alphaTab source code. 

## Get Involved

If you are using alphaTab in your project, you might encounter easter eggs (aka. bugs) or have the need for 
new features that do not exist yet in alphaTab. 

We accept all kind of requests via [GitHub](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/issues/new/choose) just open a new issue
by choosing one of the templates and filling it out with your request. 

:::important
Please follow the templates and do not just delete all information and drop in a 1 liner question. It is very important
to get all the information asked in the template to judge the importance and content of the request. 2 minutes effort
on your side, reduces heavily the effor on our side. We will close any issue not following the templates.

# Join the Code

You're a developer? You want to contribute code to alphaTab? Awesome! alphaTab is developed on GitHub using a GitFlow alike branching strategy. 

The main new development happens on `develop` and new features are usually developed on `feature/{feature or issue name}`. To get started 
you can fork alphaTab into your account, and start preparing a fix/feature there in the style you prefer. Then just open a pull request. 
If you're not new to Git and GitHub you know the drill ;) 

## License

alphaTab is developed under MPL-2.0 and any source code you contribute you agree that you transfer the ownership of your change to alphaTab. 
By this we do not want to "take away" your change, but we want to keep the freedom to potentially change the license to something more open or different (e.g. MIT)
without the need of checking with hundreds of people if this change is possible. Of course we also would not make such a change without discussing it publicly before. 

A primary goal is to keep alphaTab a free an open source library for anyone to integrate. 

## Toolchain

You're still here? That sounds very promising. You have made your fork, you cloned the repo and now you would be ready to start developing. 
But how is the big question. Before we actually touch the code it is helpful to understand the toolchain we have in alphaTab.

As you might already know alphaTab is developed currently in C# and by this produces a .net library. There is nothing special at this point.
But it becomes more special on how we build our JavaScript library. To build the JavaScript version of alphaTab we are first compiling our C# code
to [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). 

"Why all this overhead?" you might ask. Well, I'm a huge fan of C# and its tooling. Hence I wanted to develop alphaTab in C#, but still provide it
as Web Library. Haxe is a really nice meta language for cross compiling one source base to many other target languages. alphaTab 
was using Haxe already in the past before we switched to C# and the performance and output code quality was just way better than any other
cross compilation technology we used. 

Okay, but Haxe does not support C# as input, so we made our own C# to Haxe compiler named Phase. This brings us to the following toolchains:

What's still a lot of overhead of course and not many people are familiar with this. This is the main reason why we are planning to move 
to a TypeScript based toolchain. This way the main source base will become **TypeScript** based for the web, but with a custom cross compiler
for the other platforms we want to ship. 

Which brings me to the next aspect of alphaTab development. It aims for zero dependency and cross platform / language usage. 
The main modules of alphaTab are written as standalone source code without 3rd party dependencies and with a style that allows 
execution on any potential platform with a garbage collector built in (.net, JavaScript, Kotlin/Java,...). It is an active strategy
to provide a platform native solution to any major platform on the market. 

## Development Environment

The main development can happen within any .net IDE which can built C# projects (Rider, Visual Studio or VS Code). It is up to you to decide 
which one you would like to use. 

Beside a .net environment you will need to install: 

* [Haxe 3.4.7](https://haxe.org/download/version/3.4.7/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Following NPM packages should be installed globally on your system.

`npm install -g uglify-js`

Then you can simply open the AlphaTab.sln and compile the projects. 

## Project Structure

**AlphaTab.Shared**

Contains the shared platform code. This is where the main code of alphaTab lives. 

**AlphaTab.CSharp**

Executes the .net pipeline and builds a NuGet package containing the .net libraries.
Contains any .net platform specific code. 

**AlphaTab.JavaScript**

Executes the JavaScript pipieline building the final minimized JavaScript file. 
Contains any JavaScript platform specific code. 

**Test/AlphaTab.Test**

Contains the shared platform code for the overall unit test suite. 

**Test/AlphaTab.Test.CSharp**

Contains the tests for the .net platform including the shared tests. (can be run from Visual Studio)

**Test/AlphaTab.Test.Js**

Contains the tests for the JavaScript platform including the shared tests. (Needs manual run via karma)

**Samples/***
