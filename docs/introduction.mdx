# What is alphaTab?

**alphaTab** is a JavaScript and .net library for building music notation software and websites. It allows you to take any of 
various supported input files, and embed good looking and feature rich music sheets into your website.

As of today alphaTab is **not** a drop-in component that provides all functionality out of the box. You should rather consider it as 
an **SDK** or **Library** to build components in the way you need it in your website. The needs to music sheets vary from application to application 
and website to website. You will need a certain development skillset to integrate alphaTab into solution.

:::note
The JavaScript and .net version of alphaTab are sharing the same source code. We take our C# code and compile it to JavaScript 
using a special toolchain.
:::

On high level alphaTab can be structured into the following submodules: 

1. The data model
2. The file importers
3. The render engine
4. The audio engine

All these 4 modules together make up alphaTab and allows you to provide modern and interactive music notation into your website or application. 

## The data model 
The data model which holds all information about a piece of music. This includes general information like
song title and artist but goes down to individual note level. Everything alphaTab needs to render or play music sheets
is stored in this data model. 

## The file importers
To fill the data model alphaTab uses so called `Importers`. There exist various file formats in the market which can hold
the information about music sheets. alphaTab has importers for: 

* Guitar Pro 3-5 files `.gp3`, `.gp4`, `.gp5` which are a proprietary binary format from [Arobas Music](https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php?pg=about)
* Guitar Pro 6 files `.gpx` which are a proprietary archive format storing the music information as XML 
* Guitar Pro 7 files `.gp` which are a zip archive storing the music information as XML
* MusicXML files `.xml` which is an open XML based [standard](https://www.musicxml.com/). 
* [alphaTex](/docs/alphaTex) which is a text based format optimized writing music notation in a textual format

:::note
There exist many *dialects* of MusicXML and due to its very nature of describing music sheets in a very visual way, 
only a limited subset of MusicXML is actually supported. If you encounter issues or missing features do not hesistate
to contact us on Gitter or GitHub to add support for missing features.

## The render engine
This engine is what makes the music sheet visible. alphaTab takes all the information stored in the data model 
and does a visual layouting and rendering which is called music engraving.

For this alphaTab builds up a visual tree represntation of all the symbols following the rules of music notation. 
Using this model alphaTab can very efficiently provide dynamic resizing and relayouting. 

The symbols alphaTab is using the [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/) music font [Bravura](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura)

## The player
To bring the music to life, alphaTab comes with a MIDI synthesizer embedded. To play the music sheet, alphaTab will convert the data model
into MIDI commands, which are then played by a MIDI synthesizer based on [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont).

We take the data model, convert it to MIDI, put this midi together with a SoundFont2 into the audio engine and viol√†, we have the 
song being played for human ears. 

alphaTab can provides user interactivity and a visual cursor out of the box.
