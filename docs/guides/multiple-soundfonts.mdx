title: Use multiple SoundFonts to reduce traffic 
---

Since alphaTab v1.1 you can load multiple soundfonts into alphaTab depending on the 
needs of the song loaded. This guide will show you how to setup alphaTab in a way
that it loads only individual soundfonts from the server depending on the ones
needed by the loaded score. 

## Data Preparation

First we need to slice down our SoundFont into smaller chunks. We will use [Polyphone](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/)
a free SoundFont editor to do this. 

The slicing that makes sense, strongly depends on what kind of music pieces you plan to offer to your users. 
For simplicity in this example we will just slice the soundfont into 2 files: 

1. sonivox-main.sf2 containing all guitars (midi 24-31) and drums 
2. sonivox-others.sf2 containing the other files

You can of course go that far to put each instrument into an own file. A typical music piece usually
will not contain more than 4-5 different instruments which should still allow fast download of the files. 
Modern browser limit the number of concurrent requests to the server, so you might slow down the data loading.
