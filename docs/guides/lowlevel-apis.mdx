This guide explains how to use the low level APIs of alphaTab in case the full API object cannot be used or is not needed. 

The full API object is usually linked directly to a UI via a `IUiFacade`. There exist various `IUiFacade` implementations
for the different platforms like for Web, .net WPF and .net WinForms. 

In scenarios where none of these UI platforms are used or if not even a UI exists, you will need to use the low level APIs 
of alphaTab to setup the individual steps manually.
