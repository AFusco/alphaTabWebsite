## Description
AlphaTab needs to know the full URL to the script file it is contained in to launch the web workers. AlphaTab will do its best to auto-detect
this path but in case it fails, this setting can be used to explicitly define it. Altenatively also a global variable <code>ALPHATAB_ROOT</code> can
be defined before initializing. Please be aware that bundling alphaTab together with other scripts might cause errors 
in case those scripts are not suitable for web workers. e.g. if there is a script bundled together with alphaTab that accesses the DOM,
this will cause an error when alphaTab starts this script as worker. 

<PropertyDescription metadata={metadata} />

## Types

<TypeTable>
    <TypeRow name="string" />

## Default Value
Absolute url to JavaScript file containing alphaTab. (auto detected)
