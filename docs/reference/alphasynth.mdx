`AlphaSynth` is one of the low level APIs that can be used if no full alphaTab API object with UI interaction
can be used or is needed. It is the audio synthesis engine of alphaTab which is used to play a midi file
using a generated midi file and a SoundFont as input. 

This page describes all methods, properties and events exposed by this class.
