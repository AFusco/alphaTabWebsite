## Description

This setting configures whether the player feature is enabled or not. Depending on the platform enabling the player needs some additional actions of the developer. 
For the JavaScript version the [Player.SoundFont](/docs/reference/property/soundfont) property must be set to the URL of the sound font that should be used or it must be loaded manually via API. 
For .net manually the soundfont must be loaded. 

AlphaTab does not ship a default UI for the player. The API must be hooked up to some UI controls to allow the user to interact with the player.
