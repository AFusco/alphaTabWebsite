title: Setup Project
---

First we will set the stage for our new component. For simplicity we will put all our code into one `index.html`.
We also will be using the Content Delivery Network (CDN) jsdelivr.com to consume alphaTab into our project so there
will not be a need for any webserver, opening this index.html in your browser of choice will work for all steps in 
this tutorial. 

If you prefer, you can also organize the project already into individual JavaScript and CSS files.
For the sake of simplicity in this tutorial we put everything together.

As a step 1 create an `index.html` in any folder and open it the editor of your choice and your browser. 

<img src="/img/tutorial-web/project-setup-1.png" />

Once done we will add the basic wireframe of our page and include alphaTab. For this put the following code into 
your `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>AlphaTab Tutorial</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@coderline/alphatab@latest/dist/alphaTab.js"></script>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* Our Styles will go here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="at-wrap">
      <!-- Our whole component will go into this wrapper -->
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Our JavaScript code will go here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

But now the page is still empty. In the next step we will setup alphaTab and show some music notation.
