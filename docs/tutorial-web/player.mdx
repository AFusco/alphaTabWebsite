## Basic setup

Now as we have the basic component ready, it is time to get some sound into the game. 
AlphaTab comes with an audio synthesis engine, named AlphaSynth to play the songs
via Midi and a SoundFont2 file. 

To get the player configured is also quite easy: 

1. We tell alphaTab that we want the player active and where to find the SoundFont2 file that should be used. 
Luckily alphaTab ships a free SoundFont2 file for usage on your website. 
2. We tell alphaTab how the cursors should look like
3. We add some UI elements for the user to start/pause the playback and show the current position.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Initialize Player', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'Cursor Styles', value: 'css', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const settings = {
  file: "https://www2.alphatab.net/files/canon.gp",
  player: {
      enablePlayer: true,
      soundFont: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@coderline/alphatab@latest/dist/soundfont/sonivox.sf2'
  }
};
const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(main, settings);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="css">

```css
.at-cursor-bar {
  /* Defines the color of the bar background when a bar is played */
  background: rgba(255, 242, 0, 0.25);
}

.at-selection div {
  /* Defines the color of the selection background */
  background: rgba(64, 64, 255, 0.1);
}

.at-cursor-beat {
  /* Defines the beat cursor */
  background: rgba(64, 64, 255, 0.75);
  width: 3px;
}

.at-highlight * {
  /* Defines the color of the music symbols when they are being played (svg) */
  fill: #0078ff;
  stroke: #0078ff;
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Loading indicator

Just like alphaTab, alphaSynth might need some time to initialize and load all required data. 
Especially the SoundFonts can become quite big and might need some time to load. So we will
add a small loading indicator to our footer so that the user will know once the player is ready
for usage.
